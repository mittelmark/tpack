<h2 id="name">NAME</h2>
<p><em>tpack</em> - create single or two file Tcl applications based on
libraries in tar/lz4 archives</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>$ tpack --help               # display usage information
$ tpack wrap app.tapp        # wraps app.tcl and app.vfs into app.tapp 
                             # where app.vfs is attached as base64 archive
$ tpack wrap app.tapp --lz4  # as above but use base64 and lz4 for compression
$ tpack init app.tcl app.vfs # creates initial file app.tcl and folder app.vfs
$ tpack init app             #            as above
$ tpack init app.vfs         # create initial folder app.vfs
$ tpack unwrap app.tapp      # extracts app.tcl and app.vfs out of app.tapp</code></pre>
<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The <em>tpack</em> application can be used to simplify deployment of
Tcl applications to other computers and customers. The application can
create single file Tcl applications. These single file applications,
called tapp-files contain at the top the base64 / lz4 extraction code,
the main tcl script and an attached base64 archive where all files are
encoded using base64 and file separation lines containing the libraries
required by this application file. At startup the base64 encoded files
are detached from the file and unpacked into a temporary folder from
where the libraries are loaded. The compression with lz4 needs an
installed lz4 executable, the decompression of the build executable is
embedded into the final application but requires a Tcl installation of
at least 8.5.</p>
<p>The single file approach creates <em>app.tapp</em> file out of
<em>app.vfs</em> and <em>app.tcl</em>.</p>
<pre><code>tpack wrap app.tapp</code></pre>
<p>The file <em>main.tcl</em> in the vfs-folder should contain at least
the following line:</p>
<pre><code>lappend auto_path [file join [file dirname [info script]] lib]</code></pre>
<p>The <em>tpack</em> application provides as well a loader for default
starkit layouts, so a fake starkit package so that as well existing
starkits can be packed by <em>tpack</em>, here a <em>main.tcl</em> file
from the tknotepad application.</p>
<pre><code>package require starkit
if {[starkit::startup] == &quot;sourced&quot;} return
package require app-tknotepad</code></pre>
<p>In this case the application file tknotepad.tcl which is in the same
directoy as <em>tknotepad.vfs</em> can be just an empty file. It can as
well contain code to handel command line arguments. Here the file
tknotepad.tcl:</p>
<pre><code>proc usage {} {
    puts &quot;Usage: tknotepad filename&quot;
}
if {[info exists argv0] &amp;&amp; $argv0 eq [info script] &amp;&amp; [regexp tknotepad $argv0]} {
    if {[llength $argv] &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; [lsearch $argv --help] &gt; -1} {
        usage
    } elseif {[llength $argv] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; [file exists [lindex $argv 0]]} {
        openoninit [lindex $argv 0]
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>That way you should be able to use your vfs-folder for creating
tpacked applications as well for creating starkits.</p>
<h2 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>Make this file <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittelmark/tpack/refs/heads/main/tpack-b64.tcl">tpack-b64.tcl</a>
executable and copy it as <em>tpack</em> into a directory belonging to
your PATH environment. There are no other Tcl libraries required to
install, just a working installation of Tcl/Tk of at least Tcl 8.5 is
required.</p>
<h2 id="example">EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s demonstrate a minimal application:</p>
<pre><code>## FILE mini.tcl
#!/usr/bin/env tclsh
package require test
puts mini
puts [test::hello]
## FILE mini.vfs/main.tcl
lappend auto_path [file join [file dirname [info script]] lib]
## FILE mini.vfs/lib/test/pkgIndex.tcl
package ifneeded test 0.1 [list source [file join $dir test.tcl]]
## FILE mini.vfs/lib/test/test.tcl
package require Tcl
package provide test 0.1
namespace eval ::test { }
proc ::test::hello { } { puts &quot;Hello World!&quot; }
## EOF&#39;s</code></pre>
<p>There is the possibility to create such a minimal application
automatically for you if you start a new project by using the command
line options:</p>
<pre><code>$ tpack init appname
# - appname.tcl and appname.vfs folder with main.tcl and
#   lib/test Tcl files will be created automatically for you.</code></pre>
<p>The string <em>appname</em> has to be replaced with the name of your
application. If a the Tcl file or the VFS folder does already exists,
<em>tpack</em> for your safeness will refuse to overwrite them. If the
files were created, you can overwrite the Tcl file
(<em>appname.tcl</em>) with your own application and move your libraries
into the folder <em>appname.vfs</em>. If you are ready you call
<code>tpack wrap appname.tcl appname.vfs</code> and you end up with two
new files, <em>appname.ttcl</em> your application code file, containing
your code as well as some code to encode and decode base64 files.</p>
<p>Attention: if mini.tapp is executed directly in the directory where
mini.vfs is located not the mini.tapp file but the folder will be used
for the libraries. That can simplify the development.</p>
<p>You can rename mini.tapp to what every you like so
<code>mini.bin</code> or even <code>mini</code>.</p>
