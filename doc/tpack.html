<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The <em>tpack</em> application can be used to simplify deployment of
Tcl applications to other computers and customers. The application can
create single and two file applications. Single file applications,
called tapp-files contain at the top the tar extraction code, the main
tcl script and an attached tar archive containing the libraries required
by this application file. At startup the tar file is detached from the
file and unpacked into a temporary folder from where the libraries are
loaded. The compression with lz4 needs an installed lz4 executable, the
decompression of the build executable is embedded into the final
application but requires a Tcl installation of at least 8.5.</p>
<p>The single file approach create as <em>app.tapp</em> file out of
<em>app.vfs</em> and <em>app.tcl</em>.</p>
<p>The two file approach creates a ttcl-file for the application and a
ttar-file for the library files. The unpacking of the library code in
the tar archives is done only if the tapp file is newer then the files
in the temporary directorywhere the files are extracted. If we assume
that we have the application code in a file <em>app.tcl</em> and the Tcl
libraries in a folder <em>app.vfs/lib</em> together with a file
<em>app.vfs/main.tcl</em>. The call
<code>$ tpack.tcl app.tcl app.vfs</code> will create two files:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>app.ttcl</em> - text file containing the application code from
<em>app.tcl</em> and some code from the tar library to extract tar
files</li>
<li><em>app.ttar</em> - the library files from <em>app.vfs</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The file <em>main.tcl</em> in the vfs-folder should contain at least
the following line:</p>
<pre><code>lappend auto_path [file join [file dirname [info script]] lib]</code></pre>
<p>The <em>tpack</em> application provides as well a loader for default
starkit layouts, so a fake starkit package so that as well existing
starkits can be packed by <em>tpack</em>, here a <em>main.tcl</em> file
from the tknotepad application.</p>
<pre><code>package require starkit
if {[starkit::startup] == &quot;sourced&quot;} return
package require app-tknotepad</code></pre>
<p>In this case the application file tknotepad.tcl which is in the same
directoy as <em>tknotepad.vfs</em> can be just an empty file. It can as
well contain code to handel command line arguments. Here the file
tknotepad.tcl:</p>
<pre><code>proc usage {} {
    puts &quot;Usage: tknotepad filename&quot;
}
if {[info exists argv0] &amp;&amp; $argv0 eq [info script] &amp;&amp; [regexp tknotepad $argv0]} {
    if {[llength $argv] &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; [lsearch $argv --help] &gt; -1} {
        usage
    } elseif {[llength $argv] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; [file exists [lindex $argv 0]]} {
        openoninit [lindex $argv 0]
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>That way you should be able to use your vfs-folder for creating
tpacked applications as well for creating starkits.</p>
<h2 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>Make this file <em>tpack.tcl</em> executable and copy it as
<em>tpack</em> into a directory belonging to your PATH environment.
There are no other Tcl libraries required to install, just a working
installation of Tcl/Tk is required.</p>
<h2 id="example">EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s demonstrate a minimal application:</p>
<pre><code>## FILE mini.tcl
#!/usr/bin/env tclsh
package require test
puts mini
puts [test::hello]
## FILE mini.vfs/main.tcl
lappend auto_path [file join [file dirname [info script]] lib]
## FILE mini.vfs/lib/test/pkgIndex.tcl
package ifneeded test 0.1 [list source [file join $dir test.tcl]]
## FILE mini.vfs/lib/test/test.tcl
package require Tcl
package provide test 0.1
namespace eval ::test { }
proc ::test::hello { } { puts &quot;Hello World!&quot; }
## EOF&#39;s</code></pre>
<p>There is the possibility to create such a minimal application
automatically for you if you start a new project by using the command
line options:</p>
<pre><code>$ tpack init appname
# - appname.tcl and appname.vfs folder with main.tcl and
#   lib/test Tcl files will be created automatically for you.</code></pre>
<p>The string <em>appname</em> has to be replaced with the name of your
application. If a the Tcl file or the VFS folder does already exists,
<em>tpack</em> for your safeness will refuse to overwrite them. If the
files were created, you can overwrite the Tcl file
(<em>appname.tcl</em>) with your own application and move your libraries
into the folder <em>appname.vfs</em>. If you are ready you call
<code>tpack wrap appname.tcl appname.vfs</code> and you end up with two
new files, <em>appname.ttcl</em> your application code file, containing
your code as well as some code from the tcllib tar package to unwrap
your library file <em>appname.ttar</em> at program runtime. The ttar
file contains your library files taken from the <em>appname.vfs</em>
folder. You can move those two files around together and execute
<em>appname.ttcl</em>, it will unpack the tar file into a temporary
directory, only if the tar file is newer than the directory and load the
libraries from there. You can as well rename <em>appname.ttcl</em> to
<em>appname</em> but your tar-file should always have the same
basename.</p>
<p>Attention: if mini.ttcl is executed directly in the directory where
mini.vfs is located not the tar file but the folder will be used for the
libraries. That can simplify the development.</p>
<p>You can rename mini.ttcl to what every you like so
<code>mini.bin</code> or even <code>mini</code>, but the extension for
the tar file must stay unchanged and must be in the same folder as the
mini application file.</p>
<p>The tpack.tcl script, the minimal application and this Readme are as
well packed together in a Zip archive which is available here: <a
