 INIParse v1.4 (C)2000

   see AUTHORS



 Usage:
   iniparse:openfile <filename> ?RDONLY?
   
 Reads an ini file into memory, for later access (such as read or write),
 and return an id which can be later used for writing/reading data, and
 flushing/closing file.

 Notes:
 - It doesn't leave the file open, just reads into memory, and returns an id.
 - If RDONLY is specified (case-sensetive), then calls to writeini will work
   only in memory, and changes won't be saved with iniparse:flush, nor
   iniparse:closefile.



 Usage:
   iniparse:flushfile <fileId>
   
 Writes an ini file in memory into its file, without removing data from
 memory.



 Usage:
   iniparse:closefile <fileId>
   
 Flushes an ini file in memory into its file, and then removes data from
 memory.



 Usage:
   readini <fileId> [ [<keyname>] [<itemname>] ]
       Reads <itemname> under <keyname> from <fileId>. If it cannot find
       file, <itemname>, or <keyname>, returns an empty string.
       If itemname is absent, returns list of all items under keyname.

 Notes:
 - This procedure doesn't read directly from the file, but from the
   memory-version of the file. If directly the file (not memory version) is
   modified after the call to iniparse:openfile, this procedure will not
   see the changes in the file, but only changes in memory-version.

 See: writeini iniparse:openfile



 Usage:
   writeini <fileId> <keyname> <itemname> <itemvalue>
	Writes/modifies <itemname> under <keyname> in <fileId>. If cannot
	find <itemname>, or <keyname>, creates a new one.

 Notes:
 - This procedure doesn't write directly to the file, but to the
   memory-version of the file. If directly the file (not memory version) is
   modified after the call to iniparse:openfile, this procedure will not
   see the changes in the file, but only changes in memory-version.

 Usage:
   iniparse:removeitem <fileId> <keyname> <itemname>
	Removes <itemname> under <keyname> in <fileId>.

 Notes:
 - This procedure doesn't write directly to the file, but to the
   memory-version of the file. If directly the file (not memory version) is
   modified after the call to iniparse:openfile, this procedure will not
   see the changes in the file, but only changes in memory-version.

 Usage:
   iniparse:renameitem <fileId> <keyname> <itemName> <newItemName>
	Renames <itemName> under <keyname> in <fileId> to <newItemName>.

 Usage:
   iniparse:renamekey <fileId> <keyname> <newKeyName>
	Renames <keyname> in <fileId> to <newKeyName>.
